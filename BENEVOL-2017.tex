\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Researchers working with software repositories, often when
building performance or quality models, need to recover
traceability links between bug reports in issue tracking repositories and reviews in code review systems.
\\
However, too often the information stored in bug tracking
repositories is not explicitly tagged or linked to the issues
reviewing them. Researchers have to resort to heuristics to
tag the data (for example, to identify if an issue is a bug
report or a work item).
\\
In this study we promote a research artifact in software
engineering, a reusable unit that can be used to
support other research endeavors and has acted as a support
material that enabled the creation of the results published
in a great number of papers until now - linking issues and
reviews of the code review process. 
\\
We present two \emph{state-of-the-practice} algorithms on how to link issues and
reviews. We selected OpenStack, the open source cloud
computing project, as case study because it enforces strict development guidelines and rules
on the quality of the data in its issue tracking repository.
\\
We empirically compare the outcome of the two approaches,
highlighting the most prominent one.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Software process data, especially bug reports and code
changes, are widely used in software engineering research.
The integration of reports and reviews, provides 
valuable information on the history and evolution of
a software project \cite{1bib}.
\\
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
Additionally, it provides means for conducting studies that qualitatively 
and quantitatively analyse fundamental parameters for characterization of 
quality and performance of the code review and the
most important metrics having a positive increasing relation
with the benefits of this process.
\\
It is used to build models which study the impact of
characteristics of issue and review discussions on the defect-proneness of 
a patch, to spot defect-introducing code
changes during review, to predict the number and locale of
bugs in future software releases, or to investigate technical
and non-technical factors influencing modern code review 
(~\cite{2bib,3bib,4bib,5bib,6bib,7bib}).
\\
However, to perform such studies, much of the information stored in software repositories must be processed and
cleaned for further analysis. Such processing and cleaning
is often done using assumptions and heuristics.
\\
The quality of these assumptions and heuristics represents 
a threat to the validity of results derived from software
repositories. Different studies by Bird et al. \cite{8bib} and Antoniol
et al. \cite{9bib} have casted doubts on the quality of data produced 
using such heuristics.
\\
To prevent or minimize such situations, we present two algorithms 
for linking issues and code review processes. We 
take into consideration the assumptions that researchers performing 
this task usually consider as true.
The results evidence do not
involve subjective context but are material facts. As such,
they can be recorded to trace the efficiency and effectiveness 
of the two methods.

\section{Methodology}

Our approach can be summed up in the following steps:
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Extraction of the information from the data sources.}
OpenStack repositories consists in the
issue tracking (Launchpad) and code review (Gerrit) 
repositories. We extracted these
data using Metrics Grimoire\footnote{https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/}, 
a toolset to obtain data from repositories related to software development, 
provided and mantained by Bitergia.
\item \emph{Identification of data needed for the linkage.} In this process we 
understand the infrastructure of both issue 
tracking and code review systems under analysis. 
We individuate the elements which hold the 
information needed to link issues with reviews. 
In the code review repository we found that a review 
holds the identification of the issue it is reviewing. 
In the bug tracking repository we found that the comments of an issue holds the 
identification of the review that is reviewing it. 
We need both information to link reviews with issues and viceversa.
\item \emph{Dataset preprocessing.} We do not need all the information 
provided by OpenStack repositories.
First, we are interested in linking issues with reviews. Thus we can ignore all 
the tickets in the bug tracking system that are not classified as bugs. 
Second, we aim to recover the linkage for fixed issues. Thus we can 
ignore all issues for which the status is other than \emph{Fix Released}.   
\item \emph{Analysis.} We executed both approaches using Jupyter Notebook, a computational 
environment where we can combine code execution, rich text, 
mathematics, plots and rich media, along with Pandas, an open source library 
specialised in providing high-performance data structures and analysis. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Approach 1 - Linking from review to issue.}

This linking approach recovers linkage from code review to issue tracking system. 
To detect the links between reviews and issues, we referred to the name of 
the branch on which a code change had been made. It follows the naming convention 
\emph{bug/989868} where \emph{989868} is the issue identifier. 
We extracted this identifiers, and then proceded with the linkage. 
In summary, the \emph{state-of-practice} algorithm is:
\\
\begin{itemize}

\item identify the \emph{related artifact};

\item apply regular expresions to extract \emph{bug\_id} from \emph{related artifacts};

\item create a link between issues and bugs matching where bug identification is \emph{bug\_id}.

\end{itemize}

The most inconvenient drawback of this approach is that, in practice, developers often 
do not report such identifiers, resulting in missing links.
%\\
%After applying this approach to OpenStack, we recovered 72\% of the links with reviews 
%linked to the issues they fix.

\subsection{Approach 2 - Linking from issue to review.}
This linking approach recovers linkage from issue tracking 
to code review system. To detect links between issues and reviews, we first identified 
the issues (bugs) and then extracted the identification of the review fixing it.
\\
The first task is not a trivial one. In Launchpad, besides issues, 
developers work with \textit{specifications} and \textit{blueprints}. 
We analyzed Launchpad workflow and found a pattern that allowed us 
to identify which tickets are issues (bugs). These tickets follow a certain 
evolution of the \emph{state} attribute.
As a next step, we preprocessed the comments of the issues to extract the 
review identifiers.
In summary, the \emph{state-of-practice} algorithm is:
\\
\begin{itemize}

\item identify \emph{bug reports};

\item exctract \emph{issue\_id}, the information related to the issue that is reviewing the bug from the comments of the bug;

\item create a link between bugs and issues where issue identification is \emph{issue\_id}.\\ 

\end{list}

Thanks to the heuristics applied in this case there are no false positives in the 
resulting dataset. 
%\\
%After applying this approach to OpenStack, we recovered 90.2\% of the links with issues 
%linked to the reviews fixing them.

\section{Results and Conclusions}

After applying both \emph{state-of-the-practice} algorithms to OpenStack, we linked 
72\% of the issues with the first approach, and 90.2\% with the second approach.
\\
Clearly one approach outstands the other. We
hope these results will be a guideline to other researchers in
future helping them to decide how to recover the links at the
best of their advantage. 
\\
While, on one hand, we tested our
approach on a single case study, OpenStack, on the other hand 
what enforces our confidence that this case acts as a representative 
for the category is that code review process follows
the same principles and practices everywhere.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
